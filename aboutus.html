			<div class="about">
			<p>Growing up in tornado alley means having to spend a portion of your life sheltered in a basement during every storm season. For the majority of my life, impending severe weather made me very anxious. My anxiousness became worse once I had my daughter, because my primary focus was then to protect her, then I. </p>

			<p>It was after a particularly violent storm season that I decided to read up a bit about how and why storms happen. Yea, I knew the basics as far as what had been taught to me in school which I needed to brush up on, but I was also interested in what new advancements had been made to study weather events.  Immediately I was hooked. I was constantly reading about weather, listening to experts speak about it, and following all weather events in our area and across the United States.</p>

			<p>At this point, I can say that I am a full fledged weather nerd, and proud of it. I have a weather station in my backyard that transmits information to weather data compiling and reporting sources, and I have a mini control center on my phone devoted to weather apps so I can see exactly what is going on, and where, no matter where I am. I am also a trained spotter, and while I have not gone out to actively spot yet, I hope to down the road when my daughter is a bit older.</p>

			<p>Tornadoes are insanely fascinating in a jaw-dropping and scary sort of way, and very unpredictable. They damage lives, kill people and animals, and shred belongings to pieces. I enjoy keeping people informed because I want them to be safe and weather aware at all times. I want to spot so I can help save lives by being the eyes to report severe weather, so that warnings can be given in order for people to have enough time to get into a shelter. </p>

			<p>Favorite weather occurrence: A good solid thunderstorm.</p>
			<p>Least favorite weather occurrence: Snow, snow and ice, ice.</p>
			<p> Weather occurrence I have yet to see with my own eyes, but hope to someday soon: Mammatus Clouds, just like the ones below... </p>
